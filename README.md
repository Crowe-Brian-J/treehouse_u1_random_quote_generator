# Random Quote Generator
This is the project page for Treehouse's Fullstack JavaScript Tech Degree Unit 1's Random Quote Generator. It will involve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript programming. Processes will be documented below.

## Quotes
Quotes will be stored as objects in an array and referenced as a source in the 'main' part of html, inserted via document.querySelector.

## Functions
The functions will be stored in a separate .js file, referenced after quotes.js, and therefore, able to be referenced despite not being in the same file.
