# Random Quote Generator
This is the project page for Treehouse's Fullstack JavaScript Tech Degree Unit 1's Random Quote Generator. It will involve HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. Processes will be documented below. I wish I knew that the files were there to be downloaded before I started this repository. It would have made my life so much easier.

### 'getRandomQuote' Function
- This function is named getRandomQuote
- It returns a random object from the quotes array
### 'printQuote' Function
